I've always struggle setting up coding environment when switching from devices to devices. Especially when I was working in a firm where I need to set up my development environment for the onboarding process, it's really painful. 
I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_5tDWsWSj0) where I was told there is a new feature in vscode that allow me to solve the issue I mentioned above. So I decided to give it a try. Essentially, devcontainer is a container that you can attach to when developing in a completely isolated and fully configured environment. In this way, you don't need to worry about development environment.  

# goal
to be able to develop a project without considering environment issues. 

# clone a project
In this tutorial, I'm gonna clone my own personal [blog engine](ghttps://github.com/pingrunhuang/blog).
# install extensions in vscode
In vscode extension tab, search for following keywords:
![](/data/2024-04-11/plugins.png)
You can either install the **dev container** extension for only dev container usage, or you can install the whole package with the **remote development**.
# start a container
After installation, you can run _shift_+_command_+_p_ in mac to start a dev container with configuration file generated.

After this process, a **.devcontainer** directory is created under root directory of the project. Inside the directory, a **devcontainer.json** file is created where the container info is recorded. 
# the devcontainer.json file
The devcontainer.json file looks like following:
![](/data/2024-04-11/devcontainer.png)
name: indicate the name of the container
image: same concept as dockerfile. The image you would love to use
features: these are dependencies that you might want to have on top of the image you get. In my case, I need hugo as the blog engine, node and npm for hugo engine. 
postCreateCommand: this are command or script you wanna run once the container is up. In my case, I need to install all the javascript dependencies once the container is up. And there are multiple commands that should be run so I need to have a script to include all the commands. 

# the result
After starting the container, you will see that all the dependencies are installed. What you edit locally will be reflected in the container. This is what I've wanted to achieve when I am developing features that require checking the result on the fly. You don't need to worry about the local environment compatability etc. 

# summary
So far, I really just tried out the basic features that devcontainer provides. 
1. get the dev container extensions in vscode
2. define dependencies in devcontainer.json file
3. define actions that need to be triggered after the environment is up.
I think there exists tons of features that dev container broght in such as volume mapping etc. I will update another post whenever I figured out the features that devcontainer brought in the table. At the mean time, feel free to comment below to tell me features that I missed or I should try out at this stage.
