Recently I've been using gerrit as a version control tool. I was taking it for granted that gerrit is some sort of github. But unfortunately, it is not. Gerrit has its own logical way of managing the version. One example is `git push`.

In github, I use `git push origin <branch_name>` for push changes to the remote repo where the branch_name is just simply the same name as remote like `master` or `dev`. However in gerrit, `git push origin dev` does not work instead of `git push origin HEAD:refs/for/dev`. Bellow is the way how gerrit work:

Obviously, gerrit fake the remote branch so that the reviewer could review the changes in the repo and confirm to push to the real remote for CI test.
