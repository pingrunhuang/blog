There are plenty of concepts related to computer science in video production actually which are so confusing for one want to get into the field of shooting higher quality of video. So in this blog. I will introduce some researches that I have done on these concepts from the perspective of a software engineer. Hopefully I can explain them clearly and get the chance to talk about how I get inspired to apply storing data in database by the way data get stored in video. Enjoy it!

> Some little concepts before hand
1. pixels
2. fps
3. color range
4. chroma sampling
5. Mbps
6. codecs


### chroma sampling
we often hear about the terms like `4:4:4` or `4:2:2` or `4:2:0`. These is refering to the chroma sampling meaning how do we want the machine to sample color(RGB or YCRCB) for image. Let's take `4:4:2` for example. The first `4` means we have 4 pixels for one row to sample. The second `2` means for the first row, we have 2 colors sampled. The last `2` means for the second row, we have 2 colors sampled.

### codecs
after you finished producing the video, you will need to save it into computer so that computers can read from it. Here is what the compression and decompression technology comes into play which is `codecs(compressor/decompressor)`. In video production, 2 methods are used quite often which are H.264 and H.265. Since this post is not about how the video get compressed and decompressed. We will not go into the details on how they work. Instead, we just need to know that they both achieved
