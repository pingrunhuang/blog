> In 2019, I started a position as a quant developer in [crypto.com](www.crypto.com). So half of the year later, in 2020, I decided to actually stacking my own money into trading crypto. See how the return rate will be at the end of this year.


## Memorial moment of my first BTC purchase

## How it goes?

I'm living in China which means the alternative exchange to purchase btc is pretty limit. Most exchange like Binance or even my own company crypto.com do not support users from china mainland. After some research on which exchange to go to, I select OKEX since I have been working on their API for a long time and feels quite ligit compares to other otc platform that support users from China mainland. And even support paying with alipay and wechat pay which is a thumbs up for those newbee want to join this community.

After deciding which exchange to buy crypto. I kept monitoring the price for `BTCUSDT` to determine which pricing range is suitable for longing. At these time, price range from `9500 USDT/BTC` to `11000 USDT/BTC` seems like a range fluctuating for a long time of period. Therefore, once the price hit around `9500` I decided to jump right on for just a little bit of money to see how it goes.

Yeah, you did not see it wrong. I just bought 100 CNY of bitcoin. Really little money right? So this is it, just a blog of marking this moment. I will be using this little money as trading initial funds. Let's see what will happen in the end of this year.
